            <p class="p-2 text-justify" id="content">
              Non- governmental organizations (NGOs) can be defined as, “legally constituted corporations created by natural or
              legal people that operate independently from any form of government. The term originated from the United Nations and
              normally refers to the organizations that are not a part of the government and are not conventional for profit
              businesses. In the cases in which NGOs are totally or partially funded by the governments, the NGO maintains its
              non-governmental status by excluding government representatives from membership in the organization.
